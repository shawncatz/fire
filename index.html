# History

.pull-left[
In 1946 at Golden Gate park Uluao Letuli Misilagi, known as Freddie Letuli,
was practicing his Samoan Knife Dance.

He saw two others practicing: a Hindu fire eater and a young girl twirling 
a baton with light bulbs fitted to the ends.

He asked the fire eater to use some of his white gas and wrapped soaked towels
around his knives. While it wasn't perfect this is the first known performance
of Flaming Sword of Samoa or Fire Knife Dance.]
