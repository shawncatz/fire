# Poi

.pull-left[
As best as historians can tell, Poi originated in New Zealand. Though it's
interesting to see how it spread across polynesia and other island areas
over time.

Poi is a Mauri word for ball on a string.

But to go from Poi to Fire Spinning requires a bit more ...

# History

.pull-left[
In 1946 at Golden Gate park Uluao Letuli Misilagi, known as Freddie Letuli,
was practicing his Samoan Knife Dance.

He saw two others practicing: a Hindu fire eater and a young girl twirling 
a baton with light bulbs fitted to the ends.

He asked the fire eater to use some of his white gas and wrapped soaked towels
around his knives. While it wasn't perfect this is the first known performance
of Flaming Sword of Samoa or Fire Knife Dance.]

# History

.pull-left[
Freddie ran many groups of dancers and performers across the US and the rest of 
the world. A lot of the fire-based (poi, staff, baton) spinning that you see at 
Hawaiian Luaus has roots in his original Fire Knife Dance]

# Fire Spinning

.pull-left[
Burning man became a place where people were interested in playing with fire 
would gravitate. Many people saw fire spinning at Burning Man for the first 
time.

Since then itâ€™s expanded massively and most areas have some form of group that 
does some form of spinning.]

# Demonstration and Learning

Depending on how much time we want to spend, I can teach you the basics of
weaves, which are one of the main movements in spinning / flow
